# Fire_detection
This repository outlines the strategy behind our team's model, which achieved second place in a Datathon organized by the Google Developers Students Club, with an emphasis on Computer Vision, specifically a Fire Detection contest. The contest attracted approximately 24 teams, with each team consisting of 2 to 4 participants. My team included two members: myself and @point516.
